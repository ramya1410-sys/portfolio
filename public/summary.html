<p> I am an educator with 3 years of experience in Computer Science and Engineering, now transitioning into front-end design. I’ve taught myself HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and front-end frameworks, gaining hands-on experience in web design. Through my teaching, I’ve developed strong problem-solving, attention to detail, and project management skills. I’m excited to bring my creative, user-focused design solutions, strong collaboration skills, and passion for continuous learning to a dynamic front-end design team.</p>
